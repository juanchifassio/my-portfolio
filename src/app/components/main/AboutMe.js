                Hi! My name is Juan Martin Fassio. I am a self taught computer
                programmer (learning since August 2021), and ever since i
                started, i have been fully immersed in the coding world. I first
                started learning Python, it's syntax, basic algorithms (and some
                really complex ones), functions, classes and methods, threads
                and much more. I began learning MySQL and managed to merge it
                with my web scraping skills (beautifulSoup ðŸ¥£), but i wanted to
                learn more. This was the moment i heard about Django, this web
                production framework, so i put my hands on it. Learning Django
                woke up my curiosity towards the front end part of web
                development. So i dug into HTML, CSS, Javascript (what a
                journey!) and finally React, the library i feel most comfortable
                working on right now.{' '}

                This was a modest summary of my journey on my pursuit of
                becoming one day a developer. My main goal now is learning new
                techs, being part of awesome projects and form incredible teams.
